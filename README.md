# About Project1
A simple alcohol detector project typically involves creating a device that can detect the presence of alcohol in a person's breath. To design and build a device that can detect alcohol levels in a person's breath and provide a visual or auditory indication if the alcohol concentration exceeds a predefined limit.
# Objective:
To create a device that can detect the presence of alcohol in a person's breath using an Arduino UNO, MQ-3 sensor, resistors, a buzzer, and an LED.

# Components:
1.Arduino UNO: The microcontroller board used to process sensor data and control outputs.
2.MQ-3 Alcohol Sensor: A sensor specifically designed to detect alcohol levels.
3.Resistors: Used to limit current and interface the sensor and other components with the Arduino.
4.Buzzer: Provides an audible alert when alcohol is detected above a certain threshold.
5.LED: Provides a visual indication of the alcohol level.
6.ower Supply: Provides the necessary power for the circuit components, typically through the Arduino board itself.

# Circuit Diagram:

1.MQ-3 Sensor:
-Connect the Vcc pin to the 5V pin on the Arduino.
-Connect the GND pin to the GND pin on the Arduino.
-Connect the Analog Output pin to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) on the Arduino.

2.LED:
-Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to a digital I/O pin (e.g., D13) on the Arduino through a current-limiting resistor (220Î©).
-Connect the cathode (shorter leg) to the GND.

3.Buzzer:
-Connect the positive terminal of the buzzer to another digital I/O pin (e.g., D12) on the Arduino.
-Connect the negative terminal to the GND.

# Working Principle:
1.Detection: The user blows into the MQ-3 sensor, which measures the alcohol concentration in their breath.
2.Signal Processing: The sensor outputs an analog signal proportional to the detected alcohol level. This signal is fed into the analog input pin (A0) on the Arduino.
3.Threshold Comparison: The Arduino reads the sensor value and compares it with a predefined threshold value set in the code.

# Output Indication:
-If the detected alcohol level exceeds the threshold, the Arduino turns on the LED and activates the buzzer.
-If the alcohol level is below the threshold, the LED and buzzer remain off.
